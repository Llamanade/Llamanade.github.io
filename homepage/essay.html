                <div class="heading">Knew York</div>
                <div class="p1">Think of a place you feel safe. Think of a place you feel accepted. Think of a place where you can be yourself. That’s New York. New York is the place to call home. You can be whatever you want to be in New York. You can find your identity. Find your community. Find your people. Find yourself. New York is home for all. You know who you are? New York is home for you. Are you still trying to figure it out? New York is home for you. Introvert? New York. Extrovert? New York. Her? New York. Him? New York. Them? New York. Anything else? New. York. I found my place in New York. It's such a nice feeling to know that you belong, whether it’s a place, a person, or a thing. It could be the bus driver you see every morning, a random alley deep in Brooklyn, or a train line. Whether it is significant to you, or someone else, or no one at all.</div>
                <div class="p2">Places that are special to you are often associated with an interaction that occurred there. It could be the corner where someone made you feel good about yourself by complimenting your shoes, or the deli that let you take your items when you were one dollar short. There are tons of small interactions that happen so often in NYC. The city is packed to the brim full of people different from you, and you have hundreds of daily interactions that expose you to so many new experiences. Most of these interactions will be forgotten within an hour, but the few that linger in your mind will stay forever. They will stay and they will forever be linked to the place where they happened.</div>
                <div class="p3">I have found my place. Christopher Park, a tiny park in the middle of the LES. The first time I went to Christopher Park, I was actually visiting Stonewall Inn. It was amazing to see Stonewall but when I turned around I saw Christopher Park, and it was an entirely different feeling. Entirely lined in alternating trans and pride flags, it felt so right. There was a warmth that spread throughout me, and I immediately knew that I wanted to come back. It’s a very small park, not even a block in length with only two benches and a gay liberation monument. There is clearly a history behind Stonewall. There were so many brave people that fought and died for their cause, but I can’t relate to them. They fought, and because of that I don’t have to so it is much harder for me to relate to them. But in Christopher Park, the flags, the benches, and the monument. Someone made the effort to place all the flags, keep the benches clean, and protect the monument. Someone accepts who I am now. Not fifty years ago. Now. Even though there is no direct contact with whoever did that, it felt nice. There was someone somewhere that didn’t even care if I saw what they were doing. They did it because they knew it was right. They wanted to show their support and didn’t care if they gained any recognition for it.</div>
                <div class="p4">The place doesn’t matter. The people who care, don’t matter. All that matters is that you care, and it is here. Once you find that place, person, or thing, it may change, but it will forever live on with you.</div>
